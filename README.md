# My_Website
<i>Deploying my own website: <a href="https://www.adarshrajpathak.me">www.adarshrajpathak.me</a> </i>

**This is the deployment of my personal portfolio website.** This project marks a significant milestone in showcasing my work and establishing my online presence as a professional.

To bring this website to life, I have invested time and effort in crafting an engaging and visually appealing design. The HTML structure of the webpage is contained in the index.html and the styling with the help of advanced external css is contained in the style_adarsh.css and also there is a readme file for the general documentation of the website.
**Currently the website is made functional with the tech stack "HTML and Advanced CSS" and a SMTP server for the form submission.**

Apart from this the _webisite will be recieving the major update_ in the form of new **tech stack** implentation _in the subsequent months on regular basis._

**The version launching is v1.1.0**
<br/>Major.Minor.Patch: This versioning scheme uses three numbers to represent major, minor, and patch versions.<br/>
<ul>
  <li>The major number represents significant updates or using a new tech stack.</li>
  <li>The minor number represents smaller updates or additions to existing features.</li>
  <li>The patch number represents bug fixes and small patches that do not introduce new features.</li>
</ul>
